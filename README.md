### Time Estimate

Number and name of feature: Feature #1 - Display a Modal

Estimate of time needed to complete: <= 1hr

Start time: 2:00pm

Finish time: 1:06am

Actual time needed to complete: This is an unreasonable metric, as I got stuck with the Modal component because by following all of the setup instructions, there was no stylesheet for react-bootstrap components, so I had to find the css file through trial and error and having a friend help me troubleshoot. If not for that snag, it would have taken me the hour to complete as predicted.
